# Welcome to Harbor!
![Harbor is fun at parties!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goharbor/website/master/docs/img/readme/harbor_logo.png)

Harbor is an open source trusted cloud native registry project that stores, signs, and scans content. Harbor extends the open source Docker Distribution by adding the functionalities usually required by users such as security, identity and management. Having a registry closer to the build and run environment can improve the image transfer efficiency. Harbor supports replication of images between registries, and also offers advanced security features such as user management, access control and activity auditing.

Harbor is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of cloud native technologies, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Harbor plays a role, read the CNCF
